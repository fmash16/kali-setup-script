# kal--setup-script

A simple bash script to setup the enviroment and tools as per my personal
preferences in kali. The extra tools installed can be found in /opt. There is
a /payload directory at /root which contains necessary files that frequently
needs to be copied to the target machine.

## Environment:
  * WM : i3
  * Terminal : rxvt-unicode

## Tools
  * gobuster
  * ffuf
